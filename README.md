- This project focused on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing real world data directly in Excel without external tools or programming languages.

- Data Cleaning:
    Removing duplicates to ensure dataset accuracy.
    Renaming columns for better understanding:
        Marital Status:M â†’ Married, S â†’ Single
        Gender: M â†’ Male, F â†’ Female
    Cleaning Income column by removing unnecessary zeros.
    Creating an Age Bracket column based on Age column

- Data Visualization & Insights:
After cleaning, I built Pivot Tables and an interactive Dashboard to summarize insights:

	Average Income by Gender Per Purchase: Males who purchased bikes have higher average income.

	Commute Distance and Bike Purchases: Most buyers commute 0â€“1 miles, indicating proximity based purchases.

	Age Bracket vs Bike Purchase: Middle age individuals are the most active bike purchasers.

- Tools & Technologies
	Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Formulas, Dashboard)

ðŸš€ Next Steps

In the future, I plan to:
	Recreate this dashboard in Power BI or Tableau for interactive visualization.

Iâ€™m sharing this project as part of my journey to strengthen my Data Analysis and Excel analytics skills before diving deeper into Data Science and AI Engineering.
